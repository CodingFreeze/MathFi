# Improved Math Symbol Recognition Model

## Model Improvements

We've made several targeted improvements to enhance the model's ability to recognize advanced mathematical symbols:

### 1. Enhanced Model Architecture

- **Residual Connections**: Added residual connections (skip connections) which help with vanishing gradient problems and allow deeper networks to train more effectively
- **Deeper Network**: Increased the depth of the network with three convolutional blocks followed by multiple dense layers
- **Global Average Pooling**: Used global average pooling to reduce parameters and improve spatial invariance
- **Optimized Regularization**: Tuned dropout rates to prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity

### 2. Data Processing Improvements

- **Class Balancing**: Added class weights to handle imbalanced classes, giving more importance to underrepresented symbols during training
- **Option to Limit Samples**: Added capability to limit maximum samples per class to create a more balanced dataset

### 3. Enhanced Data Augmentation

Improved data augmentation with:
- Increased rotation range (15° vs 10°)
- Increased shift range (15% vs 10%)
- Increased zoom range (15% vs 10%)
- Increased shear range (15% vs 10%)
- Added brightness variation
- Disabled horizontal flips (which would change the meaning of math symbols)

### 4. Training Strategy Improvements

- **Lower Initial Learning Rate**: Started with 0.0005 instead of 0.001 for more stable training
- **Smaller Batch Size**: Reduced to 32 from 64 for better generalization and gradient estimates
- **Increased Patience**: Used 20 epochs of patience for early stopping (instead of 15) to allow the model to explore solutions longer
- **More Gradual Learning Rate Reduction**: Increased patience for learning rate reduction to 7 epochs (from 5)
- **Better Model Checkpointing**: Save both the best model and periodic checkpoints

## Expected Results

These improvements should lead to:

1. **Higher Accuracy on Advanced Symbols**: The model should better distinguish between similar-looking advanced symbols
2. **More Balanced Performance**: Performance should be more consistent across all symbol classes
3. **Better Generalization**: The model should perform better on unseen handwritten examples
4. **Reduced Overfitting**: The gap between training and validation accuracy should be smaller

## Usage

To train the improved model:

```bash
python improve_advanced_model.py
```

The script includes several parameters that can be customized:
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 100)
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training (default: 32) 
- `learning_rate`: Initial learning rate (default: 0.0005)
- `model_type`: Model architecture to use (default: 'improved_cnn')

## Model Architecture Comparison

### Original CNN Model
- 3 conv blocks with simple stacking
- ~2.6M parameters
- No residual connections
- Standard regularization

### Improved CNN Model
- 3 conv blocks with residual connections
- ~5.8M parameters 
- Increased feature maps (64→128→256)
- Global average pooling
- Enhanced regularization

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further improvement:
- Experiment with more advanced architectures (EfficientNet, Vision Transformer)
- Add more sophisticated data augmentation (elastic transforms, random erasing)
- Implement more advanced learning rate schedules
- Explore semi-supervised learning approaches for low-data symbols
