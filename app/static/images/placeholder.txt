This is a placeholder file.

A gif or image showing the application demo would normally be placed here.
The README references 'mathfi_demo.gif' which would show a recording of the application in use.

To create this file:
1. Run the application using 'python run.py'
2. Upload a handwritten equation image
3. Capture the process as a short gif
4. Save it as 'mathfi_demo.gif' in this directory
